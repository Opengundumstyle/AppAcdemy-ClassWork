# vigenere_cipher

# A Caesar cipher takes a word and encrypts it by offsetting each letter in the word 
# by a fixed number, called the key. Given a key of 3, for example: a -> d, p -> s, and y -> b.

# A Vigenere Cipher is a Caesar cipher, but instead of a single key, a sequence of keys is used.
#  For example, if we encrypt "bananasinpajamas" with the key sequence 1, 2, 3, then the result
#   would be "ccqbpdtkqqcmbodt":

# # Message:  b a n a n a s i n p a j a m a s
# # Keys:     1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1
# # Result:   c c q b p d t k q q c m b o d t
# Write a method vigenere_cipher(message, keys) that accepts a string and a key-sequence as
# args
# returning the encrypted message. Assume that the message consists of only lowercase 
# alphabetic characters.
